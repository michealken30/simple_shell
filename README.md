SIMPLE_Shell ALX Simple Shell @ Mike/ Oluwakemi Project This is an ALX collaboration project on shell that mimics the Bash shell. Our shell shall be called hsh. Project was completed using C language Shell Betty linter Background Context A simple UNIX command interpreter. “The Gates of Shell”, by Spencer Cheng, featuring Julien Barbier Project Requirements: For the project, all source files will undergo compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the GCC compiler. Compilation options include -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, -pedantic, and -std=gnu89. To ensure code quality, files must conclude with a newline character. Additionally, each project folder must contain a mandatory README.md file at the root, describing the project and its functionalities. Development will adhere to the Betty coding style, verified using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

Code Standards: During our development process, we prioritize adhering to the Betty style guide. This ensures consistent formatting, readability, and maintainability of our codebase. The shell's codebase will be free from memory leaks, reflecting our commitment to producing high-quality software. To maintain code modularity and organization, we recommend a maximum of five functions per source file. All header files should be protected against multiple inclusions using include guards.

Project Description: The project involves creating a straightforward UNIX command interpreter named 'hsh.' This interpreter can execute commands from both files and standard input. Our approach includes printing a prompt, processing user commands, and executing them. The interpreter is capable of handling built-in commands, aliases, and external executable programs. Upon command execution, the program reverts to the prompt and awaits further instructions. The interpreter can be operated both interactively and non-interactively. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p-qqyKe8ykVz73tZZvghWXxz9fvgRTEh/view?usp=sharing

Professional Growth: Through this project, we have gained valuable experience in various areas of software development, including process creation, dynamic memory allocation, and collaboration within a team. Our ability to adhere to coding standards, create effective documentation, and ensure code quality is evident throughout the project. We continue to prioritize readability, maintainability, and efficiency in all our software development endeavors.
